## Contributing

I’ll be stipulating the guidelines for contributions to the repo here
1. Fork the Repository

2. Clone the repository
git clone "url you just copied"
example: git clone git@github.com:this-is-you/hng_boilerplate.git
where this-is-you is your GitHub username. Here you’re copying the contents of the first-contributions repository on GitHub to your computer.

3. Create your new feature/chore/bug branch for working
example: git checkout -b feat/add-auth or git checkout -b chore/update-auth-feature or git checkout -b fix/auth-bug-fix
Please read more on best practices here:
(https://medium.com/@shinjithkanhangad/git-good-best-practices-for-branch-naming-and-commit-messages-a903b9f08d68)

4. Make neccessary changes, add and commit those changes
example: git add . to add all your changes,
git commit -m "feat: basic auth feature"
Again refer to the blog post above for best practices with commit naming

5. Push your changes to the github upstream (your repo)
git push -u origin your-branch-name
replacing your-branch-name with the name of the branch you created earlier.

6. Submit your changes for review. Compare your changes against the dev or development branch of our repos
Your PR naming should look similar to the commit name
feat: basic authentication or feat: created Login Page or chore: updated readme file
